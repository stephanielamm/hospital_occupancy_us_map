Based on what you’ve picked up in the video lectures and the readings, I’d like you to do the following:

Make a map! You might need to wrangle raw data first. It can be interactive or static-- up to you. 

Present the saved image (upload the image to https://imgur.com/ and post the link) or if you feel uncomfortable posting publicly, describe it.

Show off the code that was used to generate it

Explain how you decided to focus on the data you used to express with a map 

Use whatever data you like, as long as you link to what you used!
